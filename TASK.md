## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Feature Parity**: 90%+ feature coverage with native app

## 📝 Notes

- **DIKW Architecture Advantage**: The frontend already has a sophisticated intelligence system that the native app lacks - this should be leveraged in all new feature implementations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features should be implemented progressively, starting with basic functionality and adding intelligence layers
- **Mobile-First**: All new features should be designed mobile-first to match the native app experience
- **Performance**: Use React Query/SWR for data fetching and Jotai for state management consistently across all features
